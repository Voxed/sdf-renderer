# sdf-renderer
An test SDF renderer I made, it supports multiple different SDF volume primitives rendering at the same time. Renderer uses raymarching.

# Benchmarks
It's capable of rendering 64 64x64 images with 5 20x8x8 volumes at 140 fps on a Vega 64.

Further optimization might be necessary for the purpose of implementing SDFGI.
